"""
Thermal conduction for the finite-difference scheme.

We add a Fourier heat-conduction term to the energy equation,

    d(rho E)/dt  +=  div(kappa grad T) ,

with the temperature taken from the ideal-gas relation

    T = p / rho            (code units, specific gas constant R = 1).

The conductivity is either the constant ``kappa = params.thermal_conductivity``
or, with ``config.conduction_density_weighted``, ``kappa = rho * alpha`` with
the diffusivity ``alpha = params.thermal_conductivity``. Three discretisations
are provided:

* 2nd order, constant kappa: ``kappa * laplacian(T)`` with the standard
  three-point Laplacian per axis (seven-point in 3D). The stencil is a constant
  linear operator on T, hence trivially differentiable, and the explicit
  parabolic time step stays cheap.
* 2nd order, ``kappa = rho * alpha``: a conservative face-flux discretisation
  with the face density taken as the mean of the two adjacent cells.
* 4th order (``config.conduction_order == 4``, either conductivity): the
  pointwise heat flux from the 4th-order central first derivative, and its
  divergence through the 4th-order conservative face interpolation. This is
  the same linear flux the WENO kernel uses, so conduction does not reduce the
  5th-order hydrodynamics to 2nd order.

Boundary conditions are **adiabatic** (zero conductive flux) at every wall: the
reflective hydro boundary mirrors density and pressure as even quantities, so
``T = p / rho`` is mirrored too and its normal gradient -- hence the conductive
flux -- vanishes at the wall.
