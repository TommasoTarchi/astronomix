"""
Gas accretion onto sink particles following Federrath et al. (2010), ApJ 713, 269.

Once per time step, after sink creation, every sink takes the gas above the
density threshold from the cells within its accretion radius (Section 2.3):
from a cell with ρ > ρ_res, the mass increment ΔM = (ρ − ρ_res) ΔV (Eq. 13)
moves to the sink and the cell is left at ρ_res. Mass and linear momentum are
conserved (Appendix B); the sink moves to the centre of mass of itself and the
accreted gas. New sinks, created with zero mass, get their mass here too.

Gas must be bound to the sink and move toward it, except in the cell that
contains the sink and above the safety density threshold ρ_safe (see
``_sink_particle_formation.py``). Above ρ_safe, inflow passing near a sink
could otherwise pile up within r_acc, where the proximity check keeps a new
sink from forming.

Only gas in interior cells is accreted. The cells around a sink wrap around
periodic axes and end at the edge of the box on non-periodic axes. Reflective
walls are treated like the other edges: mirrored gas is not counted.

The work is done per sink rather than per cell: each sink gathers the few cells
around it, so the cost scales with the number of sinks, not with the grid.
