Motion of sink particles and their gravity, following Gong & Ostriker (2013),
ApJS 204, 8.

Every gravitational interaction that involves a sink goes through the grid
(particle-mesh): each sink's mass is spread over the 3×3×3 cells around it with
triangular-shaped-cloud (TSC) weights (Gong & Ostriker 2013, Eq. 16), and the
force on the sink is read back from the same cells with the same weights. The
kicks solve the Poisson equation for gas and sink density together; the gas
feels the sinks through the potential of the sink density alone, solved once
per step and added to its own, which by linearity is the same field.
Depositing and reading back with the same weights gives a sink no force from
itself and makes the forces between any two masses equal and opposite. The
TSC weights and their first derivative are continuous in the sink position,
so derivatives with respect to the positions have no jumps.

The sinks move with a kick-drift-kick leapfrog (Gong & Ostriker 2013, Section
2.4), once per hydro step, and adaptive steps keep a sink from moving more than
half a cell per step (Federrath et al. 2010, ApJ 713, 269, Eq. 22).

The TSC cells follow the gas boundaries: they wrap around periodic axes and end
at the edge of the box on non-periodic ones. Where the Poisson solve treats the
box differently, a sink within reach of the edge (2 cells, 4 on the
finite-difference path) feels a force from itself, and the forces between
masses are not exactly equal and opposite. This happens with periodic gas and
``poisson_manual_open_boundaries``, with mixed boundaries (solved as fully
open), and with classic finite volume on a periodic box, whose ghost cells lie
inside the periodic Poisson domain.
