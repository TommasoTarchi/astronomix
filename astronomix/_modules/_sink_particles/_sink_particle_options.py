"""
Configuration container for sink particle formation.

Sink particles are created following the checks of Federrath et al. (2010),
ApJ 713, 269, Section 2.2. All options here are static (changing them triggers
recompilation), because they fix array sizes and the shape of the control
volume. The density threshold is derived from the Jeans length resolution
(Eq. 32 of the paper).
