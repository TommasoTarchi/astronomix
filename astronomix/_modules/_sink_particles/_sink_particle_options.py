"""
Configuration container for sink particles.

Sink particles are created following the checks of Federrath et al. (2010),
ApJ 713, 269, Section 2.2, with a safety density threshold above which the
checks that judge by gas motion are skipped, and they accrete the gas above
the density threshold within their accretion radius (Section 2.3). The density
threshold is derived from the Jeans length resolution (Eq. 32 of the paper).
They move with a kick-drift-kick leapfrog, once per hydro step, and all their
gravity goes through the grid (Gong & Ostriker 2013, ApJS 204, 8). All options
here are static: changing them triggers recompilation.

    """
    Static configuration of the sink particles: their formation, their
    accretion of gas and their motion.

    A sink moves with a kick-drift-kick leapfrog, once per hydro step, under
    the gravity of the gas, of the other sinks and of the external potential.
    All of it goes through the grid: the sink's mass is spread over the 3×3×3
    cells around it with triangular-shaped-cloud weights and added to the gas
    density of the Poisson solve, and its acceleration is read back from the
    same cells with the same weights, so a sink feels no force from itself
    and the forces between two masses are equal and opposite. Adaptive steps
    keep every sink from moving more than half a cell per step.

    Along a non-periodic axis a sink can leave the box. It keeps its slot, a
    warning is printed, and its gravity fades out between one cell inside and
    one cell outside the edge; beyond that it moves in a straight line. Where
    the Poisson solve treats the edge of the box differently from the gas
    boundaries (periodic gas with ``poisson_manual_open_boundaries``, mixed
    boundaries, classic finite volume on a periodic box), a sink within 2
    cells of the edge (4 on the finite-difference path) feels a force from
    itself, and the forces between masses are not exactly equal and opposite.
