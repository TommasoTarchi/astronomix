"""
Elementwise dual-energy switch (Bryan et al. 1995).

The internal energy recovered from the total energy, ``e_E = E - KE (- ME)``, is
a small difference of large numbers in kinetic- or magnetic-energy dominated
cells and is destroyed there by floating-point cancellation. The dual-energy
formalism carries a separately advected internal-energy density ``g`` and
selects, cell by cell,

    e_int = e_E   if  e_E > eta * E   (the total-energy value is accurate and
                                       captures shock heating)
          = g     otherwise           (the advected value avoids the
                                       cancellation)

This module holds the one switch formula shared by the pressure recoveries of
the finite-difference scheme (primitive recovery, eigenstructure, cold-crush
flux blending): ``dual_energy_internal_energy`` switches an internal energy,
``dual_energy_switched_pressure`` a gas pressure recovered from the total
energy. Both are plain elementwise ``jax.numpy``, so they apply to whole arrays
and to the per-cell values inside a kernel alike.

    Select the internal energy density with the dual-energy switch.

    The total-energy value is kept where it is a non-negligible fraction of the
    total energy, ``e_E > eta * max(E, 1e-30)``, and is not NaN; everywhere
    else the advected ``g`` is used. The floor on ``E`` keeps the threshold
    meaningful for a (non-physical) non-positive total energy.

    NOTE: the NaN test is the self-comparison ``e_E == e_E``, deliberately not
    ``jnp.isfinite``: the two differ for ``e_E = +-inf``, and an infinite
    ``e_E`` that passes the threshold is kept.
