"""
Shared Pallas-backend utilities used across the finite-difference and
finite-volume paths.

This module is the single place that

- imports Pallas / Triton (``pl is None`` / ``pltriton is None`` when they are
  unavailable),
- normalises ``config.backend_config.pallas_block_shape`` to a 3-tuple and
  builds the Triton ``CompilerParams`` from the configuration,
- exposes the ``backend == PALLAS`` predicate,
- holds the active device mesh and state ``PartitionSpec`` of a sharded run
  (``pallas_mesh_context``),
- provides the multi-GPU wrapper ``_pallas_call_sharded``, which turns an
  opaque ``pl.pallas_call`` into a ``shard_map`` body with a ppermute halo
  exchange, and ``sharded_roll``, the same halo exchange for the periodic rolls
  of the native-JAX stencils,
- pairs every Pallas kernel with a native-JAX tangent so that the Pallas paths
  are differentiable (``diffable_pallas_call``).

Every Pallas kernel module under ``astronomix`` imports from here, so new knobs
and fallbacks only need to be added once.

# =========== ↓ Multi-GPU shard_map + halo wrapper ↓ ==========
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every Pallas kernel in this codebase passes its state-shaped input(s) to
# ``pl.pallas_call`` via ``BlockSpec(state.shape, lambda ...: (0, 0, 0, 0))``.
# That tells Pallas/Triton that each block program may read anywhere in the
# array, which is the correct (and fast) layout on a single device, but it
# makes the call entirely opaque to GSPMD. When the input is sharded across a
# device mesh, XLA's only legal lowering is to all-gather the whole state on
# every device before each ``pallas_call``, which dominates every kernel and
# removes any strong scaling.
#
# Instead, each ``pl.pallas_call`` is wrapped in a ``shard_map`` body that
#   1. ppermutes a halo of ``stencil_reach`` cells from each neighbour shard
#      along every sharded spatial axis (periodic ring),
#   2. concatenates [left_halo, local, right_halo] on each sharded axis,
#   3. calls the unchanged kernel on the halo-padded local shard (its modular
#      indexing wraps within the padded shape; the halo cells provide the
#      correct neighbour values for the interior reads),
#   4. strips the halo from the output.
#
# The user-facing knob is ``pallas_mesh_context(mesh, spec)`` around the JIT
# trace, plus each kernel calling ``_pallas_call_sharded`` instead of
# ``pl.pallas_call(...)(args)`` directly. No kernel arithmetic changes.

    Set the active mesh (and state PartitionSpec) for Pallas kernel sharding.

    kernel that calls ``_pallas_call_sharded`` runs as a ``shard_map`` with a
    ppermute halo exchange instead of a bare ``pl.pallas_call``.

    Inside a JIT trace the kernel inputs are tracers, which carry no
    ``.sharding`` under ``AxisType.Auto`` meshes, so the wrapper needs ``spec``
    to know which spatial axes are split; the mesh axis names alone do not say
    that (a 1-axis ``("x",)`` mesh with ``P(None, "x")`` splits x, which
    ``P(*mesh.axis_names)`` would not).

    primals, the backward sweep of the checkpointed loop) are traced after

    Periodic roll along the split axis of the active Pallas mesh, computed as a

    Inside a multi-device ``pallas_mesh_context``, ``jnp.roll(x, shift, axis)``
    along the axis that the state PartitionSpec distributes over devices is
    computed in a ``shard_map`` in which every shard passes its ``|shift|``
    boundary planes to its neighbour by ppermute. GSPMD partitions the slice +
    concatenate of a periodic roll along a split axis as two all-to-all
    reshards of the whole local block instead, which costs far more
    communication than the halo. The roll is a pure data movement, so the
    result is bitwise identical to the single-device roll.

    In a reverse sweep even one ppermute per stencil shift is costly, which is
    why the native WENO tangent runs shard-local as a whole
    (``_weno._native_tangent_sharded``).

    The split axis is read from the context spec: an array with as many

    position, an array with one dimension fewer (a single field ``(x, y, z)``)
    the position shifted by one.

            Callable ``(state_inputs_local_padded..., other_args...) -> out``
            whose body builds and calls ``pl.pallas_call``. When the call
            runs inside a ``shard_map`` body, each invocation sees the
            *local* (halo-padded) shape and the kernel's internal
            ``grid``/``BlockSpec`` are built for that shape automatically.
        state_inputs:
            Tuple of state-shape arrays that all share the same sharding
            (same ``PartitionSpec``). Each one is padded with halo cells
            from neighbour shards along every sharded spatial axis.
        other_args:
            Tuple of replicated arrays (scalar dt, scalar gamma, ...)
            passed through as ``PartitionSpec()``.
        halo:
            Per-spatial-axis natural stencil reach ``(hx, hy, hz)``.
            Pointwise kernels pass ``(0, 0, 0)``; they still get the
            ``shard_map`` (so the kernel runs locally on each shard),
            just with no ppermute.
        block_shape:
            Per-spatial-axis Pallas block size ``(bx, by, bz)``. The
            halo is rounded up to the nearest block multiple so the
            padded shard remains block-divisible.
        num_state_outputs:
            Number of state-shape outputs of ``kernel_build_fn`` (1 for
            most kernels; more for kernels that return tuples of state-shaped
            arrays).
        input_halos:
            Optional per-input halo widths ``((hx, hy, hz), ...)``. Every input
            is still padded to the same block-rounded shape, but only the
            requested cells are exchanged with the neighbours; the rest are
            local edge copies. The kernel must not read those copies into any
            output it keeps. ``None`` exchanges the full padding for every
            input.
        output_halo:
            Optional halo width to keep on the state-shaped outputs, one
            per-axis tuple for all outputs or one per output. The default
            strips all padding. A kept halo lets a following local stencil
            reuse cells this kernel already computed instead of exchanging
            them again.

# == ↓ Differentiability: native-JAX tangents for Pallas ↓ ====
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Pallas kernels in this codebase use ``input_output_aliases`` for memory
# efficiency. JAX cannot transpose an aliased ``pl.pallas_call`` ("JVP with
# aliasing not supported"), so any path that hits a Pallas kernel is
# non-differentiable by default. The gap is bridged with a ``jax.custom_jvp``
# whose primal still calls the (aliased, fast) Pallas branch and whose tangent
# rule delegates to the equivalent native-JAX branch, which is
# JVP-differentiable. Reverse mode (``jax.grad``) is then derived by JAX via
# transposition.
#
# Forward simulation performance is unaffected: outside of AD the custom_jvp
# rule is not invoked and the call collapses to the bare Pallas branch.
#
# Both branches must produce the same pytree-structured output. The Pallas
# kernels reproduce their native counterparts to round-off, so the gradient
# obtained by transposing the native JVP at the Pallas-evaluated inputs is the
# gradient of the Pallas operation.
#
# A hand-written Pallas adjoint can replace the native tangent branch of a
# single kernel without changing its call sites (``pallas_vjp_call``).
