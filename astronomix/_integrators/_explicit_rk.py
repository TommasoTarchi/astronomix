"""
Generic explicit Runge-Kutta time-integration schemes.

These drivers are agnostic to the spatial discretisation and to the state
layout: the state ``u`` is an arbitrary JAX pytree (a single conserved-state
array for the hydro solvers, or the ``(q, bx, by, bz)`` tuple for the MHD
constrained-transport solver) and the *model* is supplied as a small set of
closures.  The finite-difference (WENO / CT) and finite-volume (unsplit)
solvers build those closures and call into the scheme; the heavy,
discretisation-specific work lives there, not here.

Model contract (all closures operate on the state pytree ``u``):

    pre_stage(u) -> u
        Hook applied at the start of every stage (e.g. boundary handling).
        Defaults to the identity.

    rhs(u, dt_stage) -> du
        The stage increment ``dt_stage * L(u)``, a pytree matching ``u``.

    post_stage(u) -> u   [ssprk4 only]
        Hook applied to each new stage state as soon as it is formed, before
        it is accumulated or used as the base of the next increment (e.g.
        rebuilding the cell-centered MHD fields from the interface fields).
        The final SSPRK4 combination keeps the ``_SSPRK4_FINAL_RAW`` share of
        each stage on the state as formed, so a modifying hook leaves that
        combination convex. Defaults to the identity.

    finalize(u) -> u
        Hook applied once after the last stage (e.g. recomputing the
        cell-centered MHD fields from the interface fields).  Defaults to the
        identity.

    lsrk_increment(u, du, a_coef, dt) -> du   [optional, low-storage only]
        Returns the new low-storage register ``a_coef * du + dt * L(u)``.
        Used by ``lsrk4`` to let a model fuse the ``a_coef * du`` accumulate
        into its flux-divergence kernel (memory optimisation).  When omitted,
        ``lsrk4`` falls back to ``a_coef * du + rhs(u, dt)``.

Schemes:
    ssprk4   - 5-stage 4th-order Spiteri-Ruuth SSPRK (3-register).
    lsrk4    - 5-stage 4th-order Carpenter-Kennedy 2N-storage low-storage RK.
    rk2_ssp  - 2-stage 2nd-order SSP RK (Heun).
