"""Positivity-preserving recombination of the WENO split fluxes.

The finite-difference WENO flux at an interface is the sum of two
reconstructed split fluxes, ``F_hat = f_hat^+ + f_hat^-``, upwinded from the
left and from the right. Take ``alpha`` = the largest wave speed on the
stencil. Splitting characteristic field ``s`` with speed ``alpha_s <= alpha``
makes each split flux a scaled vector

    f^+- = +-(alpha / 2) w^+-,      w^+- = w~^+- + z^+-,
    w~^+- = q +- F(q) / alpha,      z^+- = sum_s (alpha_s / alpha - 1) R_s (L_s q).

``w~`` is a physically admissible state (positive density, and pressure for
an ideal gas) whenever ``alpha >= |v_n| + c`` for the Euler equations. For
ideal MHD it is not (Wu 2018), and the scalings act on the cell's own
mirror pairs and on its inflow states summed over the axes instead (see
``_joint_inflow_scalings``). Write ``theta`` for the
scaling of the WENO face value toward its upwind cell. Following Zhang & Shu
(2012, J. Comput. Phys. 231, 2245), the forward-Euler update of a cell is a
convex combination of admissible states if all of these hold:

    w + theta d   admissible   (the face value, which flows into the neighbour),
    w~ - theta d  admissible   (the mirror about the unshifted state),
    lambda (alpha_left + alpha_right) <= 1,

with ``d = w_hat - w``. The cell's own flux cancels between the two faces, so
face-local speeds are allowed. Two scalings in [0, 1] enforce this, both
inside the reconstruction:

* every field that carries mass is split with the common speed ``alpha``,
  the stencil's spectral radius. That makes the frozen-basis splitting
  monotone for every cell of the stencil, however differently the basis
  represents it (a low-density cell with a large fast speed next to dense
  gas). Per-field speeds chosen only to keep the split states admissible
  are positive but not robust in high-Mach MHD turbulence. Fields that
  carry no mass (hydrodynamic shear waves, isothermal-MHD Alfven waves) keep
  their own speed. Their ``z`` leaves the density unchanged and only raises
  the pressure, so vortical modes keep the default dissipation;
* the face value is pulled toward its upwind state, ``w_hat -> w + theta d``,
  by the largest ``theta`` meeting the two conditions above. ``theta < 1``
  mixes the first-order candidate into the WENO combination with a weight set
  by admissibility instead of smoothness; ``theta = 1`` in smooth flow.

Both scalings use the same primitive: the largest ``t in [0, 1]`` with
``base + t * step`` admissible. Density is linear in ``t``. The pressure is
concave along any line in conserved space, so the chord between the two ends
lies below it and the chord's root is admissible: one closed-form step.

The module holds two forms of the same operations: an array form for the
native-JAX kernel (variable axis leading) and a form on per-cell tuples of
local components for the Pallas kernels.
