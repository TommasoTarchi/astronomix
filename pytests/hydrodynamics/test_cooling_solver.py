"""
Implicit radiative-cooling solver pytest (CPU, seconds).

Guards the backward-Euler solve in ``update_temperature_implicit`` against its
two failure modes:

1. **The monotonicity bound.** With the heating off, cooling is a pure sink, so
   the backward-Euler root satisfies ``T_new <= T_old`` exactly. A plain Newton
   iteration does NOT respect this: ``Lambda(T)`` is non-monotone, the Jacobian
   ``1 - dt * d(rate)/dT`` passes through zero on the falling branch of the
   curve, and the unguarded step then jumps the wrong way. On a non-monotone
   curve in float32 this gives ``T_new`` of up to 240x ``T_old``, and a
   temperature jump of that size collapses the CFL time step.

2. **Actually solving the equation.** A fixed-point sweep
   ``T <- T_old + dt * rate(T)`` diverges once the step is stiff and, after its
   iteration cap, simply returns ``~T_old`` -- i.e. it silently applies NO
   cooling in exactly the cells that most need it. The residual check below
   fails such a solver.

Both run in float32, the precision in which both failures appear.

The second half of the file runs the full ``update_pressure_by_cooling`` update
and checks the temperature-floor handling and the per-step cooling cap.
