Sink particle accretion pytest (fast).

Checks the gas accretion onto sink particles of Federrath et al. (2010),
Section 2.3: the mass, position and velocity of a new sink after its first
accretion, the conservation of mass and momentum (with and without a magnetic
field), the bound and radial velocity checks, the wrapping of the sink
position into a periodic box, and the choice of a single sink for each
accreted cell.
