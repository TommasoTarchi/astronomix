"""The shell-wise numerical diffusivities behind the FD and FV Reynolds numbers.

``make_fd_fv_reynolds_figure.py`` shows ``Re``, ``Rm`` and ``Pm`` of astronomix's
two MHD schemes; this figure shows what they are computed from. For each shell,

    dE(n)/dt = T(n) - D(n),

with ``T(n)`` the ideal transfer (``_mhd_spectral.transfer_spectra``), ``dE/dt``
differenced between snapshots and ``D(n)`` the dissipation the scheme adds, and
the effective diffusivities are ``nu_eff(n) = D_v / (2 k^2 E_v)`` and
``eta_eff(n) = D_B / (2 k^2 E_B)``.

Two layouts:

    fd_fv_transfer_spectra       nu_eff(n), eta_eff(n) and Pm(n) at 128^3 and
                                 256^3, the averaging band and the table's band
                                 means
    fd_fv_transfer_spectra_full  nu_eff(n) and eta_eff(n) for every grid, next
                                 to the full kinetic and magnetic budgets at 256^3

The full layout and every band mean are taken exactly as the table takes them:
raw (not deconvolved) spectra, the five-snapshot window centred where
``E_B/E_K`` first reaches 0.01 (``make_mechanism_table.matched_snapshots``),
``D`` and ``E`` averaged over the window before they are divided.

The curves of the three-panel layout use a lower-noise estimator of the same
quantities, over the whole passive kinematic phase: every snapshot with
``0.003 <= E_B/E_K <= 0.03`` after two crossing times, ``T`` and ``E``
time-averaged over that window, ``dE/dt`` from its end points (the exact window
average of the derivative, instead of differences of consecutive snapshots),
and ``D`` and ``2 k^2 E`` summed over logarithmic shell bins (16 per decade)
before they are divided. Its standard error comes from four contiguous
sub-windows. It reads the densely sampled kinematic-phase reruns in
``data/fd_fv/kinematic/`` (same setup and seed, spectra every 1/16 crossing
time up to ``E_B/E_K ~ 0.05``) where they exist. For the VL2 + GLM scheme
``D_B`` contains the divergence-cleaning sink ``-T_psi``. The script also
prints where in ``n`` each scheme dissipates and how much the kinematic
estimator smooths ``Pm(n)``.
